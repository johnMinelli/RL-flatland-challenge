The \textbf{Flatland challenge} consists in tackling the vehicle scheduling problem, in a controlled and simulated environment. The main approach used here is reinforcement learning, however there are several other possibilities that fall under the umbrella of combinatorial optimization.\\
The aim of the challenge, from a RL standpoint, is to allow the agents to learn how to optimally reach their target in minimal time.
